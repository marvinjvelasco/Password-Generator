## Purpose

* This challenge to to demonstrate my understanding of Javascript and Console commands.
* I was able to use Variable and Arrays to list the users different options when choosing thier password.
* I used 'If' and 'for' loops to apply user settings to their password.
* I added 'EventListener' to generate action to their button.
* I added 'concat' functions to combine arrays and user settings.
* I added Math.floor(Math.random()) to randomize user settings.
